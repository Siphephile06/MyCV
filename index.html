                    <p> 
                        <strong>Who am I?:</strong><br>
                        I am a 19 year old aspiring software engineer. I grew up in the wonderful province of Limopopo
                        in a small town called Groblersdal. I did not think I would be persuing Software Engeneering as 
                        my dream was to be a football player(just like every boy in our country) but life had other plans.<br><br>
                        
                        I am persuing this field without any knowledge of programming, but I am determined to learn.
                        I am a very hard worker and I am always willing to learn new things. I am a team player and I 
                        enjoy working with others.<br><br>
                        
                        Because of of the fact that I have no prior experience with programming, it has been very 
                        challenging throughout the course. Though I will not that stop me because quiting is not 
                        in my DNA. My biggest motivation is that everything I do I do unto the Lord as he has provide
                        with all that I have.<br><br>

                        I lived a very carefree life and I did not take my studies seriously.
                        I was more focused on playing sports and having fun with my friends.
                        Now I have learned the importance of education and I am determined to make the most of it.
